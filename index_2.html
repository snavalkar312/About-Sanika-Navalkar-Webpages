<h1>Student Council</h1>
<hr>
<br>
<p> Student council is a group of students elected by their peers to
 address issues of concern and organize student events and activities.
 At our school I see it as one of my favorite clubs. I paticipated in this club
 at my middle school, and loved it alot. I enjoyed helping out and
 having a say in planning many school activities. One of my goals is to try out
 for student body president in my near future.</p>
