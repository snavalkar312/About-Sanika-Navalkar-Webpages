<h1>HOSA</h1>
<hr>
<br>
<p>Known as Health Occupations Students of America, HOSA is an international career
 and technical student organization endorsed by the U.S. Department of Education
 and the Health Science Technology Education Division of ACTE. At our school
 it is a club for kids interested in the health sciences, like me! I joined HOSA
 because I like to take part in clubs that can hep me gain knowledge and make
 new friends. HOSA relates to me because I want to follow a career path in health
  science and HOSA seems like the perfect extracurricular activity to help
  expand my interest in that.</p>
